# Why VR
Tt's hard to estimate other people‘s mind state in VR，because sometimes they are costumed as an avater，and their expressions and movement tend to have time delay or does not match the real world. So it's hard for us to estimate emotion and dialogue atmosphere in VR. Based on VRheadset and sensors,I'd like to find a good way to estimate their mind in VR world. That's Why I want to conduct my research in VR. 
  
# Why Atmosphere
When I play VRchat, I find it hard to get acquainted quickly with other players in VRchat，
and it's not easy for us to estimate other people's mind and whole atmosphere. 
In recent years,virtual meeting,virtual social have become popular, I find it's necessary to capture the dialogue atmosphere as well as personal emotions to help players who are not good at virtual socializing
  
# Reinforced Self-Training
I read this papaer serveral months ago, it's a effective model for zero-shot learning in NLP，so I want to figure out whether it‘s still effective in my study。The proplem is that it's hard for us to get a lot of data because it's a hassle to collect it。And participants‘ self-report tend to be unaccurate because it's hard for people to estimate themselves. What's more, individual differences are very common in biometric information, I want to verify whether this model can solve individual diffrences or not.

# Transformer
It needs a lot of data for traning，and cost more time for traning.

# MAIA
I would tell them that there are situations that create bad feelings before experiments。
I use this MAIA questionnaire to confirm the accuracy of each individual's self-assessment。

# NNi
I think this should be related to the parameters I set, and the NNI will be different depending on the number of nearest neighbor points considered。
It only considers the neaerest distances in space,but i think NNI should also consider the distances in time.
